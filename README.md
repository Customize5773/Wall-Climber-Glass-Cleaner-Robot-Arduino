# Wall-Climber Glass Cleaner Robot (Arduino) ðŸ¤–ðŸ§¼

Welcome to the **Wall-Climber Glass Cleaner Robot** project! This Arduino-powered marvel is designed to autonomously clean vertical glass surfaces while safely navigating along edges. Combining motor control, ultrasonic sensing, and cleaning mechanisms, this project offers a robust platform for experimentation and further enhancements. ðŸš€

> **Inspiration:** This project draws its inspiration from the "Wall Climber Glass Cleaner Robot" featured on [nevonprojects.com](https://nevonprojects.com/wall-climber-glass-cleaner-robot/). Their innovative concept inspired the design and functionality of this implementation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robot that can:
- **Climb Vertical Surfaces:** Using suction techniques, the robot adheres to glass surfaces.
- **Clean Efficiently:** Equipped with a suction motor and a brush motor, it actively cleans dirt and grime from glass.
- **Navigate Safely:** With four ultrasonic sensors strategically placed (front, back, left, and right), the robot detects obstacles as well as potential edges. This ensures it avoids collisions and maintains a safe distance from the glass edgesâ€”preventing falls and damage.

The robot continuously monitors its surroundings and makes quick decisions:
- **Edge Detection:** If the sensor reads a distance beyond a safe threshold (indicating a potential drop), the robot stops, reverses, and then turns to adjust its path.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** When an obstacle is too close, the robot backs up and then maneuvers to find an alternate route.
- **Continuous Cleaning:** As it navigates, the suction and brush mechanisms remain active, ensuring that cleaning never stops.

## Features

- **Multi-Directional Movement:**  
  The robot employs two motors on each side (left and right) for independent control. This allows for forward movement, reversing, and simple left/right turns.
  
- **Advanced Sensor Integration:**  
  Four ultrasonic sensors provide real-time distance measurements. Two critical thresholds are employed:
  - **`minDistance`**: Detects when obstacles are too near.
  - **`maxSafeDistance`**: Flags when an edge is near, preventing the robot from unintentionally exiting the glass surface.
  
- **Dedicated Cleaning Mechanism:**  
  A suction motor coupled with a brush motor actively cleans as the robot moves, ensuring efficient removal of contaminants from vertical glass surfaces.

- **Modular and Extensible Code:**  
  The code is structured with modular functions for movement and sensing, making it easy to extend or modify according to your project needs.

## Hardware Components

Below is a summary of the hardware components and their respective Arduino pin assignments:

### Motors
| Component               | Arduino Pin | Description                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Left Motor Forward**  | 3           | Drives left side forward          |
| **Left Motor Backward** | 4           | Drives left side backward         |
| **Right Motor Forward** | 5           | Drives right side forward         |
| **Right Motor Backward**| 6           | Drives right side backward        |

### Cleaning Mechanisms
| Component       | Arduino Pin | Description                        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Suction Motor** | 7         | Activates suction for wall adhesion and cleaning |
| **Brush Motor**   | 8         | Powers the cleaning brush          |

### Ultrasonic Sensors
| Sensor          | Trig Pin | Echo Pin | Location      |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| **Front Sensor**| 9        | 10       | Front         |
| **Back Sensor** | 11       | 12       | Rear          |
| **Left Sensor** | 13       | A0       | Left Side     |
| **Right Sensor**| A1       | A2       | Right Side    |

The sensors are integrated using a simple structure to keep code clean and readable. The measured distance is computed using the standard formula based on sound speed (approximately 0.034 cm per Âµs) and divided by 2 to account for the round trip.

## Software Architecture

### Initialization
- **Pin Setup:**  
  The `setup()` function initializes all motor and sensor pins. The suction and brush motors are activated at startup, ensuring that cleaning begins immediately.
  
- **Serial Communication:**  
  Serial debugging (`Serial.begin(9600)`) is included for live monitoring of sensor readings.

### Core Loop
Within the `loop()` function:
1. **Sensor Readings:**  
   All four ultrasonic sensors are read, calculating distances in centimeters.
2. **Decision Logic:**  
   - **If the front sensor detects an edge (distance â‰¥ `maxSafeDistance`):** The robot stops, reverses, and then turns (choosing the side with a safer distance).
   - **If an obstacle is too close (distance â‰¤ `minDistance`):** The robot performs a reverse and a left turn.
   - **If left or right sensors detect an edge:** The robot adjusts by turning in the opposite direction.
   - **Otherwise:** The robot moves forward continuously.
3. **Movement Functions:**  
   Modular functions (`moveForward()`, `reverse()`, `stopMovement()`, `turnRightSimple()`, `turnLeftSimple()`) simplify motor commands and enhance code reusability and clarity.

### Sensor Functions
- **`setupUltrasonic()`**: Configures the trigger and echo pins.
- **`getDistance()`**: Sends a pulse from the ultrasonic sensor and calculates the distance based on the pulse duration. A timeout mechanism returns a high value (1000 cm) if no echo is detected, ensuring robust behavior even when the sensor fails to sense an obstacle.
